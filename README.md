# Haiku

Simple generator of haiku-style names for whatever your naming needs.

There is a library, and there is a CLI tool. They are both so simple, this README is insulting.

## CLI Example

Fine, I'll show you.

```console
$ go install ./cmd/haiku
$ haiku
tubby-endothelium
$ haiku -number
chippy-oarfish-150
```

## Word Lists
